1. generator 
    iterable object but only once and saves memory generating values lazily as one goes 

2. Pytorch format 
    Object oriented / Class based 
    init 
        super().__init__()
    forward()

3. General structure is 
    model 
    data
    train 
    utils 

4. Wavenet Architecture 
    Dilated 1D convolutions 
        increases reference window 
        dimensions reduce each time 
    Resblock: each resblock is one layer of the diagram 
    ResblockStack: A stack of the resblocks based on the #layers and repeat --> #layers dictating the dilation 
    Casual Convolution: Only considers the past 
    Dense Layer:
        Input: sum of skip connections across all the layers 
        Relu and 1by1 standard conv1Ds 
        Softmax output across 256 channels for quantised encodings that are later decoded
